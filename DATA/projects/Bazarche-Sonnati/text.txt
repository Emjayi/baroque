In mid-2018, Tonekabon Municipality, in the form of a project, asked us to present a plan for the restoration and implementation of a new phase (on the land added near the current property) of the traditional Tonekabon Bazaar within three months. In the past, this place was used as a passage, which gradually became a market with the settlement of fish and vegetable sellers there. It was interesting that due to the location, access and the presence of a mosque and a river on both sides of this passage, it had had the characteristics of an old bazaar in itself. But several major design problems had affected the project, and it had already taken away the freedom of action from the designer.
First Issue: At the time of construction and reconstruction of the bazaar complex (approximately in two years), the merchants did not have space for business and livelihood.
Second: Due to the creation of a single type for all existing shops (102 shops) in the new design, all of them had to change in their size and shape because of unequal and different dimensions. This means that merchants who owned the shop less than ten square meters had to buy the rest of the area from the owner (municipality) and those whose shop area was more than 10 square meters had to hand over the rest to the owner at a certain rate, which will definitely bring dissatisfaction to the present merchants in the market.
Third: The project request, that was defined Creating a market order and placing similar jobs together in order to provide an internal good order for the market, was one of our main priorities. But considering the 60-70 years old of some of these jobs, their relocation was not very pleasant for the shopkeeper and the people who have been buying from that shop in that specific part of the market for years; The mismatch of property prices in different parts of the bazaar was also one of the points that made this demand practically impossible.
